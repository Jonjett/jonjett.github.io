    <h2>HTML Doc</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>HTML Declaration</li>
      <p>
        &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; declares the document to the browser as an html
        file.
      </p>
      <li>Layout</li>
      <p>The basic layout of an html file as shown and templated as below;</p>
      <img size="1rm" src="images/htmlayout.JPG" alt="html layout" />
      <br />
      <p>
        In it's simplest form, an html doc can be comprised of only the head and
        the body.
      </p>
      <li>Settings/Configurations</li>
      <p>
        In most cases the html page settings and configurations are declared and
        set in the<br />
        head section. These settings can be seen declared using meta
        attributes.<br />
        The page title as well as the language used can be seen as set.<br />
        Other configuration such as linking the page to icons, or styles etc,
        can also be set here.
      </p>
    </ol>
    <h2>Syntax</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Tags</li>
      <p>
        Most of the html statements starts with a tag "&lt &gt;" and in some
        cases ends with<br />
        a closing "&lt/ &gt;"tag. Some however do not have this closing tag.<br />
        A paired tagged statement can become a parent statement, wherein nested
        tagged statements<br />
        can be inserted.The nested statement is called child statement. Whereas
        unpaired tag statements<br />
        cannot have child statements.
      </p>
      <li>Indentation</li>
      <p>
        It is common practice to follow conventional indentation where a parent
        statement can have a<br />
        block of child statements each aligned accordingly. However the browser
        does not mind at all<br />
        if this indentation is not observed and even successive spaces are
        mostly ignored.
      </p>
      <li>Case Sensitivity</li>
      <p>
        HTML is not a case sensitive programming language. Although some
        keywords are recommended<br />
        to be typed uppercase and some other form of programming stanbdards can
        be followed.
      </p>
      <li>Comments</li>
      <p>
        Comments can be enclosed with &lt;!-- &nbsp;&nbsp; --&gt;. All text
        inside these markers are comments<br />
        They can be read in the source code but not interpreted into the
        browser.
      </p>
    </ol>
    <h2>Semantics/Hierarchy</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Semantic Areas</li>
      <p>
        An html page can be semantically divided into areas. Inside the body
        there could be<br />
        a header which is the topmost of the page. And there could be a
        navigation area or panel<br />
        where some links or hyperlinks can be placed.<br />
        <br />
        Next to the header is the main secetion. In this main section there
        could be several<br />
        sub-sections. In in these sub sections there could be some divisions.<br />
      </p>
      <img src="images/hierarcareas.JPG" alt="Semantic Areas" /><br />
      <p>
        Outside of the main area there can be a side area.<br />
        Then at the bottom part there can be a footer area where credits and
        copyrights are placed.<br />
        Some or most of the described semantic areas may be optionally used or
        not. But what is<br />
        essential here is to observe the semantical hierarchy. Meaning a section
        is higher than a<br />
        division and so forth. This is important specially on significances like
        in CSS.
      </p>

      <li>Headings</li>
      <p>
        Like in semantical areas, there is also hierarchical order when using
        headings.<br />
        Again this demonstrates grouping and significances which is important
        for classifications<br />
        and when creating trace backs or links.
      </p>
      <img src="images/headings.JPG" alt="headings order" />
      <br />
      <p>
        Headings should not be used to select default font size, but rather for
        grouping and marking<br />
        the hierarchical order.
      </p>
    </ol>
    <h2>Texts</h2>
    <p>
      Text strings can be placed in a paragraph with the common &lt;p&gt; tag.
      Continuous and<br />
      multi lines can be set.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Line break</li>
      <p>
        Line break can be forced using the unpaired break &lt;br&gt; tag.Several
        breaks can be applied<br />
        to form the paragraph. Empty lines or columnar space can also be made
        with repeated breaks.<br />
      </p>
      <li>Tabs and Spaces</li>
      <p>
        Tabs can be set with the use of styling in CSS. To insert more white
        space, use the entitiy<br />
        for space.Use the entity "nbsp" for space. Repeated use is possible,
        otherwise use CSS
      </p>
      <li>Entities</li>
      <p>
        Entities are special characters that cannot be displayed with regular
        keyboard input due to<br />
        interaction with some syntax rules and inherent limitations. Some
        special characters can be<br />
        displayed by using the entity symbol of ampersand & followed by the
        entity name then semicolon ;<br />
        <br />
        One example is to display the less than and greater than to display
        &lt;html&gt;, typing as it is<br />
        would be interpreted as a valid tag.This can be done by typing & folowed
        by lt which is entity<br />
        name for the lest than sign followed by semicolon ; Then type html and
        again by another entity<br />
        gt for greater than sign. Search over internet for the list of these
        entities.
      </p>
      <li>Lorem</li>
      <p>
        Lorem is a way to add dummy words to easily populate a test paragraph.
        <br />
        To have 20 random latin words in html, type Lorem followed by the number
        of words.<br />
        Typing Lorem20 then press tab, will generate 20 latin words.
      </p>
      <li>Immediate Styling</li>
      <p>
        Immediate styling is possible but not recommended to modify the
        appearance of some words<br />
        in a line or sentence. These styling tools are called emphasis or em's.
        The word or words needs<br />
        to be enclosed with a pair of em tags. <br />
      </p>
      <img width="600" src="images/in_formatters.JPG" alt="text emphasis" />
      <p>It is highly recommended to do all styling instead in CSS.</p>
    </ol>
    <h2>Images & Videos</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Image</li>
      <p>
        Images can be inserted by using the &lt;img&gt; tag. By default it has 2
        attributes<br />
        - src ="" : Refers to the path or location of the image<br />
        - alt="" : Refers to the alternate text that will be shown if the image
        is not found.<br />
        <br />
        Image styling like location, corners, even size can be added as
        attributes.
        <br />
        &lt;img src="/testimg.jpg" alt="This is test image" width="300", &gt;<br />
        <br />
        Some of the common attributes that can be configured;<br />
        width, height, border-radius(corner roundness), float(location left,
        right),<br />
        margin (extra space, also like margin-left, margin-right etc..)
      </p>
      <li>Video</li>
      <p>
        Videos can be inserted with the &lt;video&gt; paired tag. Default
        attribute is the src or video path<br />
        <br />
        &lt;video src="" &gt;&lt;/video&gt;<br />
        <br />
        Additional attributes can also be added such as height, width etc.<br />
        And to be able to be played and controlled the attribute controls
        without value can be added. <br />
        <br />
        &lt;video height="500" width="800" controls src="" &gt;&lt;/video&gt;<br />
        <br />
        Even autoplay attribute can be added so the video plays automatically
        when loaded.<br />
        <br />
        &lt;video autoplay height="500" width="800" controls src=""
        &gt;&lt;/video&gt;<br />
      </p>
    </ol>
    <h2>Lists</h2>
    <ol>
      <p>
        There are 2 (two) types of lists, unsorted using &lt;ul&gt; and ordered
        using &lt;ol&gt; <br />
        unordered uses bulleted list and ordered using numbered lists. <br />
        <br />
        Items can be successively listed using list item &lt;li&gt; as shown
        below.<br />
      </p>
      <img src="images/list.JPG" alt="html list" />
    </ol>
    <h2>Tables</h2>
    <ol>
      <p>
        Tables can be created by using the &lt;table&gt; tag. Enclosed in this
        tag rows can be <br />
        created using &lt;tr&gt; . Initially each column headers can be defined
        using &lt;th&gt;. <br />
        Then further rows can be created similalry using &lt;td&gt; for each
        cell data. <br />
      </p>
      <img src="images/table.JPG" alt="sample table" />
      <p>
        Table borders or outline can be made visible using style. Define border
        as seen below;
      </p>
      <img src="images/table2.JPG" alt="outlined table" />
    </ol>
    <h2>Anchor/Links</h2>
    <ol>
      <p>
        Links can be created by using anchor tag &lt;a&gt;. It has one main
        attribute and it is href="" <br />
        the location of the link to go to. It could be a URL, a local page, or a
        local element in the page.<br />
        The other parameter that can be set is the representation of the link.
        Can be a text where it would <br />
        be underlined indicating it is a link, or an element like an image. This
        representative link is placed <br />
        inside the anchor tag.
      </p>
    </ol>
    <h2>Forms</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Input Fields</li>
      <li>Buttons</li>
      <li>Radio Buttons</li>
      <li>Selections</li>
